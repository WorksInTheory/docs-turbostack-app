# DNS

The Hosted Power [customer center](https://portal.hosted-power.com/) has an application to manage DNS domains.
It can be used to manage existing domains, or new ones after registering a new [domain](./domains)

!!!danger Control panels
if you already use a control panel like `DirectAdmin` or `cPanel`, we recommend using those internal DNS management tools. More information on DNS management in those control panels can be found in their own respective knowledge bases.
!!!

## Nameservers

The Hosted Power name servers:

```yaml
ns1.hosted-power.com
ns2.hosted-power.com
ns3.hosted-power.com
```
When transferring a domain, the current name servers will remain active until you manually switch to our name servers. Make sure all necessary DNS records are present before updating the name servers!
