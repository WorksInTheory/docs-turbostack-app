# SSH tab

This tab allows you to add your SSH public key to the server, enabling keypair authentication for SSH.

![SSH tab](img/sshtab.png)

We recommend toggling the option 'Only allow SSH authentication by keys' **on** when all SSH keys have been added. This provides extra security, even when your system user credentials have been compromised!

Need help creating your SSH key, or need help deploying your key(s) on cPanel or Directadmin? Have a look [here](../../Miscellaneous/ssh.md)!

!!! info
If deploying several SSH keys, please consider using [Groups](../groups.md)! This allows centralised access management over all servers, eliminating the need to control access on your servers separately.
